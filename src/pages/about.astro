                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiaathena/" target="_blank">Sophie</a>
                    has been a mental health advocate for many years.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    One day, a student approached her and asked if they could talk. Sophie brought her to the office, where the student suddenly broke down and said, <i>“My friend took his own life.”</i> Through tears she continued, <i>“I don’t understand… he has a loving family, he’s smart, good-looking, does well in school, he’s popular, he has a beautiful girlfriend — and then suddenly this happened. I don’t understand.”</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophie did her best to comfort her, and the student left feeling a little lighter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following week, during class, Sophie asked her students if they wanted to talk about self-harm and suicide. Many hands went up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was meant to be a discussion about cash-flow management became a conversation about mental pain, shame, self-harm, and suicide. Students shared stories about themselves, their friends, and their family members — people who were struggling but didn’t know where to go for help, or believed help didn’t exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the class ended, students thanked Sophie for opening the conversation and creating a safe space where they could finally speak honestly about things they had never been able to say out loud before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That day stayed with her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For someone in deep emotional pain, being able to talk to caring people — people who make them feel seen, heard, understood, and validated — can make a life-changing difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Sophie researched mental health crises and suicide further, she realized this problem is global. People everywhere struggle, yet many still don’t know how or where to find support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is when Sophie and her team decided to build a website that gathers crisis resources in one place — accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that need, the LifeLines Project was born.
