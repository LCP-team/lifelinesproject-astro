                Our Story
            </h1>
            <div class="text-left flex flex-col gap-3 mt-10">
                <p>
                    LifeLines began with lived experience.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Alan grew up in British Columbia — spending much of his childhood in Pender Harbour and his adult years in North Vancouver before moving to Asia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many Canadians abroad, he experienced the quiet ache of missing home. The loneliness. The cultural adjustments. The frustration of navigating unfamiliar systems without a local support network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He realized he could not be the only one feeling this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of Alan’s close friends — a fellow world traveler originally from Saskatchewan — once shared a reflection about community that deeply shaped the vision for LifeLines:
                </p>
                <div class="flex flex-col gap-2 italic px-10">
                    <p>
                        “Community to me is the space beyond myself that I interact with, benefit from, and contribute my own resources to; those that are shared amongst us as a collective of individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having the fortune to experience and rely on community while living in different countries, it has come to mean so much more to me than my immediate physical neighbours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My sense of community, through necessity and choice at times, often extends to virtual communities, which fulfill that need for communication of ideas, values and experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why do I continue to seek community? <br>
                        Community offers the opportunity for growth — growth in expression, compassion and ultimately wisdom.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After his friend’s passing from cancer, those words carried even deeper meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that reflection — and from real experiences of loneliness, resilience, and the need for accessible support — LifeLines was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision is simple but urgent:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A trusted, one-stop place where Canadians abroad can quickly find verified crisis resources — and a community where they can connect, share, and grow together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LifeLines stands on three beliefs:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-5">
                    <li>Access to crisis support should not depend on geography.</li>
                    <li>Community can exist beyond borders.</li>
                    <li>Growth often begins with connection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We are building LifeLines so that wherever Canadians are in the world, they know this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are still connected. <br>
                    You are still part of a community. <br>
                    And support is within reach.
                </p>
